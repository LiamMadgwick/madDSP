# madDSP
my DSP library.. contains objects for audio processing written in c++.

Not all of this is my work...
Some has been modified from DAISYsp libraries..
Which in itself has been modified from Mutable Instruments libraries..
Some has been modified from musicDSP.org..
Some is based off DAFX by udo zolzer.

These are objects and functions I have compiled in one place, 
that I find useful for audio-processing in JUCE; and on the DAISY platform.
